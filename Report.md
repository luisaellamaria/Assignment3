1. How does Spark optimize its file access compared to the file access in MapReduce?
> Ans:

2. In your implementation of WordCount (task1), did you use ReduceByKey or groupByKey method? 
   What does your preferred method do in your implementation? 
   What are the differences between the two methods in Spark?
> Ans: 

3. Explain what Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is and the benefits it brings to the classic MapReduce model.
> Ans: The Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is 

4. Imagine that you have a large dataset that needs to be processed in parallel. 
   How would you partition the dataset efficiently and keep control over the number of outputs created at the end of the execution?
> Ans: 

  If a task is stuck on the Spark cluster due to a network issue that the cluster had during execution, 
  which methods can be used to retry or restart the task execution on a node?
> Ans:
